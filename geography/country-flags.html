<h1> Remembering Country Flags </h1>

A collection of memory tips I liked, interesting flag meanings, some historical background and pointing out common themes and elements. <br> 
Again, very much in progress & updated semi-frequently as I learn, but intend to cover every country flag eventually. no maps or images yet.

</div>

<h2> Asia </h2>
<ul>
 	<li> <div> <h3> West Asia </h3> <br>
	The Pan-Iranian colours  White, Green and Red are used in a lot of Iranian countries and regions. They represent the three classes of society <br>
	White  Mobads i.e. a Zoroastrian priest; white to represent holiness <br>
	Red  Military Nobility <br>
	Green  Farmer Community <br>
	</div> </li>
</ul>

<h2> Africa </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Lots of countries use the Pan-African Colours of green, yellow and red, the colours of the flag of Ethiopia, because Ethiopia is one of the only African countries (the other being Liberia) to not have been colonised. <br>
	Red, black, and green are also used in some flags to represent Black Nationalism </li>
	<li> Ethiopia- see above </li>
	<li> Botswana- The blue represents water (especially in the form of rain), since it is a precious resource in Botswana since 70% of Botswana is in the Kalahari Desert. The Black and White stripes refer to racial unity and also the stripes of a zebra, the national animal of Botswana. (the Zebra is also the national animal for that reason i.e. its black and white stripes representing racial unity) </li> 
</ul>

<h2> Oceania </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Nauru- The yellow band with the blue background is meant to represent the equator and the Pacific Ocean. The star just below the yellow band represents Nauru's location as an island 1 degree below the equator. The 12 points of the star represent the island's original twelve tribes, and the white colour of the star represents phosphate, as that used to be a major natural resource of Nauru. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Europe </h2>
<ul>
 	<li> Germany: From dark times, through bloody wars, into a golden future   for black, red, gold </li>
</ul>
