<h1> Herogine's Mnemonic System </h1>
A system for memorising sequences of digits. <br><br>

We will associate some consonant sounds with each digit. This is something you need to memorise only once. <br> <br>

1: t/d/th etc. <br>
2: n <br>
3: m <br>
4: r <br>
5: l <br>
6: sh/ch/j <br>
7: k/g <br>
8: f/v <br>
9: p/b <br>
0: s/z <br> <br>

Note that they come in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(phonetics)"> voiced/unvoiced pairs </a>, so you only need to remember one of the sounds for each digit. Here are some (imperfect) tricks to remember at least one of the consonants for each digit: <br> <br>
1: t has one vertical line <br> 
2: n has two vertical lines <br>
3: m has three vertical lines <br>
4: f-o-u-r ends in an 'r' <br>
5: The Roman Numeral for 50 is L <br>
6: 6 looks like a mirrored cursive 'j' <br>
7: Two sevens make k <br>
8: 8 looks like a cursive 'f' <br>
9: 9 rotated 180 degrees looks like 'b' <br>
0: z-e-r-o starts in a z <br> <br>

Now, for any phrase, we have an associated sequence of digits. Note that we should determine the digits phonetically, not according to the actual consonants in the spelling. <br>
e.g:  <br>
'Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia' -> KPD D FR NSKLPD -> 791184207591 <br>
'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet' -> LRM PSM DLR ST MT -> 5439031540101 <br>
'Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin' -> DRTh MR KRFT JKN -> 141347481672 <br> <br>

Hence, to memorise any string of digits, you just need to come up with a phrase that has the required consonants. For example, for the first 20 digits of PI, you can remember the following: ''. <br> <br>

I randomly generated 3 phone numbers to try this: <br>
88718 17668: Fave activity? (to) catch Shiva <br>
7364 321375: Kimchi remained mythical <br>
92322 07999: Panamanian psycopath baby <br> <br>

You can make modifications like deciding not to count prepositions, articles, endings coming from verb conjugations etc. as part of the encoding, in order to make it easier to form phrases. It's also quite common to use Herigone's Mnemonic System in conjunction with the PAO system i.e. instead of forming a random phrase from the consonants, you group them to form a <b>P</b>erson/<b>A</b>ction/<b>O</b>bject/Person/Action/Object... word sequence. The idea is that, each P-A-O block corresponds to an evocative image of a person (a celebrity, profession, fictional character etc.) doing the action (some verb) to the object (some noun), so you can remember a sequence of images instead of a long phrase. <br> <br>

An interesting article on a similar system developed in South India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katapayadi_system, which works for the Devanigiri script.
