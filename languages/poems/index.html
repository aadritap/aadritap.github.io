<h2> Persian Poetry </h2>

Hafiz, 15th century: <br>
Translated by Daniel Ladinsky (could not find the original) <br><br>

In a holy book I have there are pages from <br>
the Bible and the Koran. <br><br>

And pages from the sutras and from the <br>
Upanishads, the Torah, and the Gita. <br><br>

And pages of things that unknown saints <br>
wrote in collaboration with the heavens <br>
that people have never seen. <br><br>

And pages of the wisdom of animals and <br>
their young singing while they played, the <br>
way we once did with the stars. <br><br>

And pages of plants and pages of sounds. <br>
And pages of earths. <br><br>

Yes, it is all there in my soul, anything ink <br>
has ever preserved, anything that stone ever <br><br>

begged to have carved on it, anything any <br>
instrument gifted from its mind, or a brush <br>
left for us to see. Any space sanctified by <br>
dance, I know. <br><br>

And anything that will ever be, written in <br>
your heart. You, the eyes or ears and cells <br>
that now hear this. <br><br>
 
In a holy book I have, in a sacred text I carry, <br>
is the face of everyone who will ever be. <br><br>

<h2> Haikus </h2>

By Taneda Santōka (種田 山頭火) (1882-1940): <br>
Translations by R.H. Blythe<br><br>

しとどに濡れてこれは道しるべの石 <br>
This is the stone, <br>
Drenched with rain, <br>
That marks the way. <br><br>

鉄鉢の中へも霰 <br>
Into the iron bowl also,<br>
Hailstones. <br><br>

<hr><br>

By Fukuda Chiyo-ni (福田 千代尼) (1703-1775, Edo period): <br><br>

蜻蛉釣り今日はどこまで行ったやら <br>
Dragonfly catcher, <br>
How far have you gone today <br>
In your wandering?<br><br>

Her (the poet's) son passed away at a young age... <br><br>

<hr><br>

By Kobayashi Issa (小林 一茶) (1763-1828): <br>
Issa is one of the great four Haiku poets of Japan. <br><br>

世の中や鳴虫にさい上づ下手 (? possibly incorrect) <br>
Even with insects—<br>
some can sing,<br>
some can’t.<br><br>

露の世は露の世ながらさりながら<br>
This dewdrop world --<br>
Is a dewdrop world,<br>
And yet, and yet . . .<br><br>
