			<ol>
				<li>One player controls the tigers and one player controls the goats. Players alternate turns</li>
				<li>The player controlling the tigers can either move one tiger to an adjacent vertex or capture a goat by jumping over it to an empty space</li>
				<li>The player controlling the goats must first place all twenty goats, one per turn. Once all goats have been placed, they use their turn to move one goat to an adjacent space.</li>
				<li>The tigers win if they capture at least 9 goats. The goats win if they can surround the tigers and leave them with no moves.</li>
