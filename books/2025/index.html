<h1> Books I have been reading in 2025 </h1>

<p> Something that made this year's book list markedly different is the amount of non-fiction in it, and the number of books written by Indian authors or books that are at least about India. The vast vast majority of books I have read in my life are fiction (likely a 1000+), while I don't know if I have read even a dozen non-fiction books. </p>

<p> Even before the start of the year, I was looking for fictional books written by Indian authors but I still haven't been able to find anything I like or feel I can fully understand. I have also, since November, been wanting to read 'Memoirs of a Rebel Princess', by Abida Sultaan but I have very frustratingly been unable to find a copy anywhere, not even a pirated one.</p>

<hr> <h2>2. Emma— Jane Austen</h2>

	<img src = "emma.jpg" alt="Book Cover">

<p> Coincidentally, I happened to have watched 'Clueless' just a few days before picking up this book. I didn't realise Clueless was based on Emma until I had already read a good portion of it. Maybe I made some kind of subconscious connection between the main characters (I had some vague notion of what Emma was about) and that's why I chose to read it. <p>

<p> I really enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. This book was a little different— it was definitely an entertaining and fun book (the riddles!), and very progressive in many ways, but also a bit disappointing in a moral sense. I'm not sure that Emma's progress in terms of character development by the end of the book is actually progress— and I don't know if that's intentional from Jane Austen or not. </p>

<hr> <h2>5. October Junction— Divya Prakash Dubey</h2> 

	<img src = "october-junction.jpg" alt="Book Cover">

	<p> I read it to help with my Hindi learning, because it uses very simple language and I surprisingly found it very comprehensible. However, aside from that, it is definitely one of the worst books I have ever read. </p>

<hr> <h2>7. The Song of the Magpie Robin— Zafar Futehally</h2>

	<img src = "song-of-the-magpie-robin.jpg" alt="Book Cover">
	
	<p> Biography written by Zafar Futehally, a famous Indian Conservationalist and relative of Salim Ali. The book mentioned many places which were very familiar to me (Bombay National Historical Society, Raman Research Institute etc.) or places I had just recently visited (Sanjay Gandhi National Park), which I have never experienced before in a book. He was a major figure in most of the major conversation organisations in India, so it was a good overview of the history of conservation in India and also to get a perspective on conversation from someone on the 'inside'; he talks both about the science and politics involved. </p>
	<p> Of course he was also a bird lover and, aside from the interesting facts he mentioned (which was made doubly enjoyable by actually being able to recognise these bird names through my interest in bird-watching), it was nice to hear about his approach to birding— more focused on enjoying seeing the same bird repeatedly and taking joy in observing their habits rather than chasing seeing as many species as possible. I am thinking of looking at some of the editions of the famous periodical he ran— '<i>Newsletter for Birdwatchers</i>'. </p>
