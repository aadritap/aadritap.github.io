<h1> Books I've read in 2025 </h1>

<h2>After Dark-- Haruki Murakami</h2>
<h2>Emma-- Jane Austen</h2>
<h2>Earthlings-- Sakaya Murata</h2>
<h2>Hindoo Holiday-- J.R. Ackerley</h2>
<h2>October Junction-- Divya Prakash Dubey</h2> 
I read it to help with my Hindi learning, because it uses very simple language and I surprisingly found it very comprehensible. However, aside from that, it is definitely one of the worst books I have ever read.
<h2>The Bell Jar-- Sylvia Plath</h2>
<h2>The Song of the Magpie Robin-- Zafar Futehally</h2>
Biography written by Zafar Futehally, a famous Indian Conservationalist and relative of Salim Ali. The book mentioned many places which were very familiar to me (Bombay National Historical Society, Raman Research Institute etc.) or places I had just recently visited (Sanjay Gandhi National Park), which I have never experienced before in a book. He was heavily involved in almost all the major conversation orgs in India, so it was a good overview of the history of conservation in India and also to get a perspective on conversation from someone on the 'inside'; he talks both about the science and politics involved. Of course he was also a bird lover and, aside from the interesting facts he mentioned (which was made doubly enjoyable by actually knowing these birds), it was nice to hear about his approach to birding-- more focused on enjoying seeing the same bird repeatedly and taking joy in observing their habits rather than chasing seeing as many species as possible.  
<h2>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man-- James Joyce</h2>
<h2>The Lost World of Hindustani Music-- Kumar Prasad Mukherji</h2>
<h2>Musafir Cafe-- Divya Prakash Dubey</h2>
Also a terrible book-- see October Junction review
