<h1> Books I have been reading in 2025 </h1>

<p> Something that made this year's book list markedly different is the amount of non-fiction in it, and the number of books written by Indian authors or books that are at least about India. The vast vast majority of books I have read in my life are fiction (likely a 1000+), while I don't know if I have read even a dozen non-fiction books. </p>

<p> Even before the start of the year, I was looking for fictional books written by Indian authors but I still haven't been able to find anything I like or feel I can fully understand. I have also, since November, been wanting to read 'Memoirs of a Rebel Princess', by Abida Sultaan but I have very frustratingly been unable to find a copy anywhere, not even a pirated one.</p>

	<hr> <h2>2. Emma&mdash; Jane Austen</h2>

	<img src = "emma.jpg" alt="Book Cover">

	<p> Coincidentally, I happened to have watched 'Clueless' just a few days before picking up this book. I didn't realise Clueless was based on Emma until I had already read a good portion of it. Maybe I made some kind of subconscious connection between the main characters (I had some vague notion of what Emma was about) and that's why I chose to read it. <p>

	<p> I really enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. This book was a little different&mdash; it was definitely an entertaining and fun book (the riddles!), and very progressive in many ways, but also a bit disappointing in a moral sense. I'm not sure that Emma's progress in terms of character development by the end of the book is actually progress&mdash; and I don't know if that's intentional from Jane Austen or not. </p>

	<hr> <h2>5. October Junction&mdash; Divya Prakash Dubey</h2> 

	<img src = "october-junction.jpg" alt="Book Cover">

	<p> I read it to help with my Hindi learning, because it uses very simple language and I surprisingly found it very comprehensible. However, aside from that, it is definitely one of the worst books I have ever read. </p>

	<hr> <h2>7. The Song of the Magpie Robin&mdash; Zafar Futehally</h2>

	<img src = "song-of-the-magpie-robin.jpg" alt="Book Cover">
	
	<p> Biography written by Zafar Futehally, a famous Indian Conservationalist and relative of Salim Ali. The book mentioned many places which were very familiar to me (Bombay National Historical Society, Raman Research Institute etc.) or places I had just recently visited (Sanjay Gandhi National Park), which I have never experienced before in a book. He was a major figure in most of the major conversation organisations in India, so it was a good overview of the history of conservation in India and also to get a perspective on conversation from someone on the 'inside'; he talks both about the science and politics involved. </p>
	<p> Of course he was also a bird lover and, aside from the interesting facts he mentioned (which was made doubly enjoyable by actually being able to recognise these bird names through my interest in bird-watching), it was nice to hear about his approach to birding&mdash; more focused on enjoying seeing the same bird repeatedly and taking joy in observing their habits rather than chasing seeing as many species as possible. I am thinking of looking at some of the editions of the famous periodical he ran&mdash; '<i>Newsletter for Birdwatchers</i>'. </p>
